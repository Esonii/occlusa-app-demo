# ===============================
#  OCClUSA PROJECT RULES
#  Expo + React Native + Expo Router
#  Atomic Design Architecture
# ===============================

# ==== LAYERS ====
# Components must only exist in:
components/atoms
components/molecules
components/organisms

# ==== DISALLOWED PATHS ====
# Cursor must NOT create components here:
components/ui
components/common
components/shared
components/base

# If these folders are present, treat them as legacy and prefer moving files
# into the atomic folders instead of adding new code inside them.

# ==== COMPONENT RULES ====
- Atoms: smallest visual units (images, text wrappers, icons).
- Molecules: small reusable blocks (dropdowns, practice picker, cards).
- Organisms: multi-section UI (headers, lists, dashboard sections).

# ==== SCREEN RULES ====
Screens MUST ONLY live inside:
app/
app/(tabs)/
app/<routes>

Do NOT place screens inside components/.

# ==== LOGIC RULES ====
Hooks live in /hooks/
They must NOT import components.
They may import utils and constants.

# ==== ASSETS ====
All images MUST live in:
assets/images/

Do not store images inside components.

# ==== LOGO RULE ====
The Occlusa logo MUST be used from:
assets/images/occlusa-logo.png
And wrapped by:
components/atoms/OcclusaLogo/

Do NOT recreate SVG or TSX versions of the logo unless explicitly instructed.

# ==== IMPORT ORDER ====
1. react / react-native
2. expo packages
3. third-party libs
4. hooks
5. constants
6. components (atoms → molecules → organisms)

# ==== NAMING RULES ====
- Components use PascalCase.
- Screens end in "Screen" only if needed.
- Atoms and molecules get folder names that match component names.
- Avoid kebab-case, snake_case, and deep nesting.

# ==== AUTOGEN RESTRICTION ====
Cursor should ONLY generate UI components inside:
components/atoms
components/molecules
components/organisms

Cursor should NEVER generate files directly in app/ except screens.
Cursor should NEVER auto-create new folders outside the defined structure.
