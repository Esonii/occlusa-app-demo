OCCLUSA APP PROJECT RULES
Expo + React Native + Expo Router
Condensed Atomic(ish) Design (Mobile)
===============================
==== PROJECT SHAPE (EXPO) ====

This is an Expo app with Expo Router.

Route-level UI (screens) MUST live inside:
app/
app/(tabs)/
app/<route-groups>/

Do NOT place screens inside components/.

==== LAYERS (UI COMPONENTS) ====
Components must only exist in:

components/atoms
components/molecules
components/organisms

==== DISALLOWED PATHS ====
Cursor must NOT create components here:

components/ui
components/common
components/shared
components/base

If these folders are present, treat them as legacy and prefer moving files
into the atomic folders instead of adding new code inside them.
==== COMPONENT DEFINITIONS ====

Atoms: smallest visual units (Text wrappers, icons, small buttons, small image wrappers).

Molecules: small reusable blocks (cards, list items, pickers, form rows).

Organisms: multi-section UI (headers, tab bars, page sections, complex lists).

==== SCREEN / ROUTE RULES (EXPO ROUTER) ====

Screens and route files MUST ONLY live in app/.

Allowed examples:
app/index.tsx
app/(tabs)/home.tsx
app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx

Do NOT create screen files in components/.

==== LOGIC RULES ====

Hooks live in:
hooks/

They must NOT import UI components.
They MAY import utilities and constants from:
constants/
utils/

==== ASSETS ====

All images MUST live in:
assets/images/

Do not store images inside components.

==== LOGO RULE (CRITICAL) ====

The Occlusa logo MUST be used from:
assets/images/occlusa-logo.png

And wrapped by:
components/atoms/OcclusaLogo/

Do NOT recreate SVG or TSX versions of the logo unless explicitly instructed.

==== STYLING RULES (REACT NATIVE) ====

Do NOT create .css files (React Native does not use CSS).

Use StyleSheet, NativeWind, or inline styles consistent with the existing codebase.

Keep styles colocated with the component when reasonable.

Do not create random global style files unless the project already uses them.

==== IMPORT ORDER (MOBILE) ====

react / react-native

expo packages (expo-router, expo-*, etc.)

other third-party libs

hooks

utils / constants

components (atoms → molecules → organisms)

local helpers (defined in the same file)

==== NAMING RULES ====

Components use PascalCase.

Screen naming: do NOT force a "Screen" suffix unless it improves clarity.
(Route filenames should follow Expo Router conventions.)

Atoms/molecules/organisms get folder names that match component names when needed.

Avoid kebab-case, snake_case, and deep nesting.

==== CODE CONDENSING RULES (IMPORTANT) ====

DO NOT create "one tiny file per tiny view" components.

It is OK and PREFERRED to keep small, related helper components in the SAME file
as the parent if they are:

Only used in that parent, AND

Very small / simple.

Only extract a new file when:

A component is reused in multiple places, OR

It is complex enough to deserve its own file.

Avoid creating new folders just to hold a single trivial component.

Keep the component tree readable but not over-fragmented.

==== AUTOGEN RESTRICTION ====

Cursor should ONLY generate UI component files inside:
components/atoms
components/molecules
components/organisms

Cursor should ONLY generate route/screen files inside:
app/

Cursor should NEVER:

Generate random files at project root (beyond standard Expo config files that already exist).

Auto-create new top-level folders outside the defined structure.

Generate component files inside app/ (app/ is for routes/screens only).
